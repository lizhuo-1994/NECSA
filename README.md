# Neural Episodic Control with State Abstraction
An extension of NECSA on continuous and discrete action space (big state size).

[EMAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08832) is for MuJoCo environments (Discrete action space).

[GEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06469) is for Atari environments (Continuous action space). 

We inherit EMAC and GEM and further perform modifications upon thier repositories.
