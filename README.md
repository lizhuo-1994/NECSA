# Generative Model-Based Testing on Decision-Making Policies
  * This work is based on the implementation of paper [MDPFuzz: Testing Models Solving Markov Decision Processes](https://github.com/Qi-Pang/MDPFuzz). Please refer the original repo for installation.

## 0 Introduction

  * This work is uses a 1D diffusion model as test case generators for decision-making models.

## 1 Anaconda

  * wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
  * bash ./Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
  * (should be changed)echo 'export PATH="$pathToAnaconda/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
  * (optional) conda config --set auto_activate_base false
  * conda env create -f env.yaml
  * conda activate necsa

## 2 Install

## 3 Execution:
  
  * Run test by our method in BipelWalker:
         
         python test_gen.py --method generative+novelty --hour 12

  * Run repair based on the detected failures:
         
         python retrain.py --alg tqc --env BipedalWalkerHardcore-v3 --folder rl-trained-agents/

## 4 Experiment results:

  * Data will be automatically saved into ./results

## 5 Citing and Thanks 

  * Our program is highly depending on MDPFuzz, thanks to the efforts by the developers. Please kindly cite the paper if you referenced our repo.
